\title{Correlation and Cohen's d effect sizes.}
\description{This function calculates the correlation for the data and Cohen's d effect sizes, both based on pooled and on treatment standard deviations.}
\usage{cordata(Before,After,data)}
\arguments{
  \item{Before}{a numeric vector giving the data values for the first (before) measure.}
  \item{After}{a numeric vector giving the data values for the second (after) measure.}
  \item{data}{an optional data frame containing the variables in the formula. By \code{default} the variables are taken from \code{environment (formula)}.}
}
\details{This function computes the correlation between both measures as also both effect sizes based on Cohen's d statistic.

The inputs must be numeric.}
\value{Return a table containing the correlation, effect size pooled and effect size based on treatment.}
